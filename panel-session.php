		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<div>
			
			When focusing on industrial applications and societal benefit, conversations in the control community need to turn from theorems and algorithms to innovation and technology management. Theory and rigor will always distinguish control from most engineering disciplines, but it has become increasingly critical to connect the dots that lead to viable products, solutions, and services. This is no abstract objective; it is intimately connected to the visibility and impact of our field, to our ability to attract the best students, and to maintain and even enhance support for our foundational research.

			<br><br>
			This panel convenes a number of leaders in control science and engineering, with experience across industry, academia, and government, to discuss how the impact of control technology can be furthered. Questions that the panel will address include the following:
			<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 4%">
				<li>How can societal imperatives in clean energy, smart transportation, intelligent manufacturing, and other fields inform research and development in control?</li>
				<li>Can we identify best practices and capture lessons learnt in academic/industry collaborations?</li>
				<li>What programs can universities offer in technology management and innovation that can help the control research community get out of its shell?</li>
				<li>How should researchers interested in commercializing their inventions proceed?</li>
				<li>Are the tools of control theory relevant to innovation and technology management processes?</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			The session will begin with presentations by the chair and panelists, focusing on one or more of the above questions. A moderated discussion will follow, delving into details based on common interests of the panelists and audience participation. We will close with short statements from the panelists.
