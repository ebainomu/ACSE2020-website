		We have received a tremendous response to publicity efforts for CCTA 2017, so we expect a much larger crowd than originally anticipated.   Thanks to all participants for helping to make the first annual IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications a memorable occasion!
	</p>



	<p>
		Below is a schedule of events for the conference. The various venues for conference events, all located on the property of the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, are as follows:
		<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 3%">
			<li >
				Mauna Lani Lanai - As the focal point of technical program sessions, this area is outside the Ballroom and other meeting rooms, located on the lower level next to the Honu Pond & Garden, in the northern area of the main building (ocean side).
			</li>
			<li>
				Hale Hoaloha Pavilion - This large, stand-alone venue is a short walk from the hotel front circle on the mountain-side of the hotel. This facility will be used for plenaries and Transition to Practice Keynote, the special Monday evening panel session, and the conference banquet.
			</li>
			<li>
				Poolside Lawn - This is a grassy area south of the main pool, where the Welcome Reception will be held.
			</li>
			<li>
				Milo Tree Lawn - Another grassy area next to the sand below a large tree, in the southwest area of the hotel property at water's edge, where the Closing Reception will be held.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Please note that the Tutorial Workshops require a separate registration for attendance, and admission to the banquet comes with full registration (member/nonmember); see details on the registration page. Welcome and Closing Receptions, plenaries, technical sessions, CSS Awards Ceremony, and the special Monday evening panel session are open to all registered attendees. Be sure to peruse individual pages on this website for complete information, and to check back to this page occasionally for updated summary information (times are subject to change).
