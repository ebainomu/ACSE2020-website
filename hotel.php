	<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger">
		Because of the unanticipated large number of attendees for CCTA 2017, we expect the conference hotel to sell out. If you cannot book a room because of availability, please see the information below about the official CCTA 2017 overflow hotel, and other hotels in the area, as well as information on local transportation.  Also, you may wish to occasionally check back with the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel because rooms will open up as cancellations occur.

		<h1>Overflow Hotel: Hilton Waikoloa Village</h1>
		<p>
			The Organizers of the CCTA 2017 have negotiated room rates at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for attendees who choose not to, or are unable to book a room at the conference venue (Mauna Lani Bay Hotel). By car, the Hilton Waikoloa Village is located 12 minutes from the conference hotel.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rates negotiated by the CCTA organizers for conference attendees, excluding Resort Charge, range from $199/night to $279/night, depending on the room requested and depending on whether in Ocean, Palace, or Lagoon Towers. Note that these rates do not include the mandatory Resort Charge and taxes that are automatically added to the bill per night. Organizers of CCTA 2017 have negotiated a special reduced rate of $15.00/night for the Resort Charge (normally it is $30) to accompany these room rates. The Resort Charge includes several amenities (such as in-room internet access), although we note that Hilton Waikoloa Village does not include self-parking in the regular Resort Charge for their guests.

			Please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/K/KOAHWHH-ICC-20170823/index.jhtml" style="color:red">click here</a> to reserve your room at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Other Hotels</h1>
		<p>
			From the south near Kona to north of Mauna Lani Bay there are many hotel options. Other than the official overflow hotel (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/K/KOAHWHH-ICC-20170823/index.jhtml" style="color:red">Hilton Waikoloa Village</a>), we recommend the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/koamc-waikoloa-beach-marriott-resort-and-spa/" style="color:red" target="_blank">Waikoloa Beach Marriott</a> which is approximately 12 minutes by car from the conference hotel (very near the Hilton Waikoloa Village). In addition, you may consider the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/orchid-hawaii" target="_blank" style="color:red" href="">Fairmont Orchid Hotel</a>, which has the advantage of being in the Mauna Lani resort area with complementary inter-resort shuttle service to and from the Mauna Lani Hotel. 

		</p>
		<br>

		<h1>Local Transportation along the Kohala Coast</h1>

		<h2>From Airport</h2>
		<p>
			Renting a car at the airport is recommended as the best option for getting around the Big Island. However, several other options exist for local transportation from Kona Airport (KOA) to the resort hotels in the area of the conference hotel. We recommend the Kona Airport shuttle by <a href="https://www.hawaiiactivities.com/en/hawaii/big_island/a/108238" target="_blank" style="color:red">Roberts Hawaii</a> or <a href="https://www.airportshuttlehawaii.com/shuttles/hawaii/" style="color: red" target="_blank">Hawaii Airport Express Shuttle</a> for a rate of approximately $30 each way, but it is strongly advised that you secure reservations ahead. Taxi service is also available for a higher rate.  Because introduction of Uber service is new and limited on the Big Island, at the time of this writing we cannot reliably recommend it.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Between Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and Hilton/Marriott</h2>
		<p>
			CCTA 2017 organizers recommend renting a car as the absolute best option for getting around on the Big Island, especially if you are not staying at the conference hotel; generally, cars may be rented either at your hotel or at the airport. However, for those attendees who are staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village (the official overflow hotel) or at the nearby Marriott (a short walk from the Hilton), the CCTA 2017 organizers will be looking into arranging for shuttle service to and from the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel. Because of high costs, the decision as to whether or not this service is provided will depend on the number of guests and need. Information will be posted on this website (please check back often) and will be available at the conference registration desk.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are renting a car on the Big Island, please note that self-parking during all conference events at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel is complementary for CCTA 2017 attendees. Moreover, overnight parking is complementary for hotel guests as part of the resort package included in your hotel room charge.
