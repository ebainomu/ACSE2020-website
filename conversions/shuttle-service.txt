<h1>Shuttle between Hilton Waikoloa Village and Mauna Lani Bay Hotel</h1>The Organizers of the CCTA 2017 have contracted with Big Island Transportation to provide van shuttle service between the overflow and conference hotels.  While intended for attendees staying at the Hilton, note also that this service can be used by guests staying at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel to explore the Kings’ Shops and the Queens’ Marketplace (very close to the Hilton Waikoloa and Waikoloa Beach Marriott hotels). These two unique shopping areas have several restaurants for lunch and dinner, including a food court at Queens’ Marketplace. The vans are contracted to stop only at the Hilton Waikoloa and the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, and gratuity for drivers has been pre-paid. Accessing the Vans The Big Island Transportation vans will have signs identifying with CCTA 2017. Please note that travelers must be wearing the CCTA 2017 Name Badge, or be accompanied by someone who is. Pick-up and drop-off points are:* Hilton Waikoloa Village Hotel: Hilton Lower Lobby (not the main circle). For guests staying at the Hilton, locate the elevator and stairs behind the Kohala Esscence Shop in the main lobby that lead down to the lower lobby. Van transportation will be located outside of the large glass doors.* Mauna Lani Bay Hotel: Main circle in front of hotel.Shuttle Van ScheduleThe van service will run at multiple times each day, with minivans and larger vans looping between the two access points. Travel time is approximately 12 minutes each way, so a complete loop takes approximately 30 minutes. Note on the schedule below the van starting points of each time interval; vans do not run past the noted end time.  We recommend that you arrive at the access point early to assure that you have a ride, because seats will be limited. Please note that the schedule might be altered midway through the conference dates if usage of the service is less or more than anticipated.Sunday, August 27 * 8:00AM – 10:00AM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 3:00PM – 5:15PM (two vans, every 15 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 6:15PM – 8:15PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 7:00PM – 9:00PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)Monday, August 28 * 7:00AM – 9:00AM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 7:15AM – 10:15AM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 11:30AM – 1:45PM (two vans, every 15 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 6:15PM – 8:30PM (two vans, every 15 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)Tuesday, August 29 * 7:30AM – 9:45PM (two vans, every 15 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 11:45PM – 1:45PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 6:15PM – 9:15PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 8:00PM – 10:00PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)Wednesday, August 30 * 7:30AM – 9:45PM (two vans, every 15 minutes, beginning at the Hilton)* 11:30AM – 1:30PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 12:15PM – 2:15PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 3:45PM – 5:45PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)* 4:30PM – 6:30PM (one van every 30 minutes, beginning at the Mauna Lani)
