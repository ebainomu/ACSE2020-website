# IEEE Conference Website Template
An easily editable IEEE Conference Website template

## Introduction and Motivation

While there is a distinct visual "appeal" for the historical look and feel of the typical IEEE conference website design, it is time for a slightly more updated approach to the conference websites.  This repository provides the busy conference chair a beautiful template that he/she can pass along to whomever they choose to delegate (coherce?) the frustrating/tedious website update.  Our goal is to make it easy (and familiar) to modify the content to be relevant to the conference/event at hand.

There are a number of well developed CMS (content management system) technologies out there: Drupal, Wordpress, etc.  Each of these CMS platforms pose their own set of flavors and features and provide great power and flexibility to the user.  It is highly recommended to not reinvent the wheel when remaking a CMS, and provide non-power users an easy to use web interface to manage and upload web content.  Like any good software team, however, we completely decided against this age-old wisdom and did not use one of these systems. Instead we started from scratch and built a very minimal, half-baked version of a CMS (if you can even call it that).  We chose this path for a couple reasons:

1. Powerful CMS systems can sometimes be difficult for a novice to setup and deploy
2. Powerful CMS systems often require specific server settings and databases which cannot be guaranteed to be present on all hosting environments
3. It was requested that if we do remake a site, that it be easily editable for the future generations of conference chairs and that we shouldn't deviate to much from the "common template experience"
4. We were kindly volunteered to do this task, and given all the other paid work we needed to do, we really didn't want to take on a full template implementation! (but were still too tired of looking at the old site designs keep perpetuating the existing template design)

We chose to use PHP (the same language that Pradeep Misra put the current operating template with years ago - and he did a good job back then!).  While it is far from our first choice of languages to use, given all the great new technologies that we work with every day, we didn't want to introduce something new.  Plus, PHP has a huge user base and can be deployed just about anywhere the bits and bytes roam.  With that said, we also attempted to bring a smattering of the 21st century to this template by making a simple configuration file "coded" in JSON (javascript object notation).  JSON is a really lightweight, human-readable format that is used in most modern webservices (and some databases!).  By using JSON, we hope to provide you a one-stop-file to put most (if not all) your website configuration data into, without having to dig around in the web code to make simple tedious template changes.

Below is a step-by-step guide in making this template your own!

## Step 1. Get the Template
There are a couple of ways to get the files in this template to start modifying:

1. Use `git` and "clone" the repository.  If you do it this way, we assume you have some experience in cloning git repositories: `git clone https://github.com/bjyurkovich/ieee-conference-web-template.git`
2. Press the "Download Zip" Icon in the top corner of this page above the file listings.

We recommend using a simple, portable editor such as [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to edit the files we mention in this tutorial.

Before we begin with modifying our content, you should understand the organization of the template files:
```
/configuration
   config.json  (this is your main configuration file)
/css
   main-styles.css (this holds most of the template styles)
/images  (this is where you should put images you use)
   /hotel
      hotel1.jpg
      hotel2.jpg
      etc...
   hotel1-banner.jpg
   ieee-logo.png
/resources (put pdfs and other things that you want to link to like conference program)
   program.pdf
   other-pdf-file.pdf
index.php (this is where you will put your content files)
registration.php
another-content-file.php
header-left-bar.php
right-bar-footer.php
```

By keeping this file stucture, the template should work with the configuration file.

## Step 2. Modify the Configuration File
We have included a JSON configuration file that holds most of the general information, links, and resource (images, etc) locations.  This can be found in `configuration/config.json` file.  See [an overview](http://www.json.org/) in case you want to know more about JSON.

### Set Meta Data
The first thing you want to do is modify the conference meta information. This information is used in a number of places on the site:
```json
...
"meta":{
	"conferenceYear": 2017,
	"dateStart": "2017-08-27",
	"dateEnd": "2017-08-30",
	"conferenceName": "CCTA 2017"
},
...
``` 
### Set Header information
The header information needs to be set.  This information is used on the primary page header on all pages:
```json
...
"header":{
	"title" : "CCTA 2017",
	"subtitle" : "1st IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications",
	"dateTitle" : "August 27-30, 2017",
	"locationPlaceName": "The Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and Bungalows",
	"locationAreaName": "Kohala Coast, Hawai'i",
	"bannerImage":"images/hotel1-banner.jpg",
	"bannerTopPlacement" : "-310px",
	"bannerRightPlacement" : "-550px"
},
...
```
A few things to note:  

1. `bannerImage` is the filename (and folder location) of the banner image in the header and should be roughly the same size or larger as the included one (2076 × 942) if possible.  The larger the resolution the better. If it is smaller than 1920x1080, you run the risk of not filling the entire banner on some HD monitors.
2. `bannerTopPlacement` and `bannerRightPlacement` allow you to move around the banner image in order to focus it in on a good spot of the image.  Just play around with the numbers until you get it to a point that it looks good.

### Set Social Media Links
The next thing to do is set the social media links. It is trivial to make a facebook, twitter, and linkedin page for your conference, and they can add some cool things (especially twitter) to your event:
```json
...
"socialMediaLinks":{
	"facebook":"http://facebook.com/[your-site-link]",
	"twitter":"http://twitter.com/[your-conference-handle]",
	"linkedin":"http://linkedin.com/[your-linkedin-conference-page]"
},
...
```

### Identify the dates
Next, you should identify the dates and corresponding titles.  These are used in the right nav menu and dates page:
```json
...
"dates":[
	{
		"title":"Paper Submission Opens",
		"date": "December 15, 2016",
		"showInNavBar": true
	},
	{
		"title":"Invited Session Proposals Due",
		"date": "March 1, 2017",
		"showInNavBar": true
	},
	{
		"title":"Contributed and Invited Papers Due",
		"date": "March 1, 2017",
		"showInNavBar": true
	},
	{
		"title":"Notification of Acceptance",
		"date": "June 1, 2017",
		"showInNavBar": true
	},
	{
		"title":"Final Submissions Due",
		"date": "July 1, 2017",
		"showInNavBar": true
	},
	{
		"title":"CCTA 2017 Conference Dates",
		"date": "August 27-30, 2017",
		"showInNavBar": false
	}
],
...
```
The `showInNavBar` field indicates whether or not you want to the date to show in the navbar field.  If that flag is set as false, it will not show in the navbar, but will show on the dates page.


### Set the footer items and links
You will also want to set your own footer items and links:
```json
...
"footerLinks":{
	"firstSection":{
		"title":"conference",
		"links":[
			{
				"name": "Program",
				"link": "resources/ccta2017-program.pdf"
			},
			{
				"name": "Map",
				"link": "http://maps.google.com"
			},
			{
				"name": "Speakers",
				"link": "resources/ccta2017-program.pdf"
			},
			{
				"name": "Events",
				"link": "resources/ccta2017-program.pdf"
			},
			{
				"name": "Sessions",
				"link": "resources/ccta2017-program.pdf"
			}
		]
	},
	...
```
You will notice that the links are fully qualified (links starting with "http://") for outside links, and just the folder/filename if they are files (php, html, pdf, jpg, png, etc) you make.  There are four (and only four) footer sections.

For a complete example of how the configuration file comes together, see `configuration/config.json`.


## Step 3. Creating or Editing Content Files
To create or modify content files (such as the main authors page: `authors.php`), open the file or create a new file with the other content files ending with a `.php` extenstion.  This file has 3 primary components:

### Header Information
```php
<?php 
$pageTitle='Authors'; //THIS MUST BE SET FOR EACH PAGE
require 'header-left-bar.php'; //THIS MUST BE INCLUDED FOR EACH PAGE
?>
```
The header information sets the page title (in this example, "Authors").  The page title is what is displayed on the main title bar of each content page.  The `header-left-bar.php` file contains the PHP/HTML code to generate the header and left navigation bar. 

> The `$pageTitle` variable must be set before the `require 'header-left-bar.php';` line is specified.  

### Your Page Content
You can use your own HTML, text, pictures, or whatever you want at this stage to replace the existing content.  You may notice that we included a few CSS classes to use in case you want them (like rounded pictures, text formatting, etc).  You can look through some of the example pages in the templates to see the options.

> In the event that you want to include your own CSS stylesheet to be loaded for the page you are editing, you can do so by adding a line above `require 'header-left-bar.php';` that sets the variable `$stylesheet` css stylesheet file and location.  For example: `$stylesheet='css/my-own-custom-stylesheet-that-I-made.css';`

### The rest of the page
Make sure to include the rest of the page template.  The `right-bar-footer.php` file contains the right navigation bar that holds the dates and the footer code:
```php
<?php require 'right-bar-footer.php'; //THIS MUST BE INCLUDED FOR EACH PAGE ?>
```
This should be the last line in every one of your content files.

All together, your page should look something like this:

```php
<?php 
$pageTitle='Authors'; //THIS MUST BE SET FOR EACH PAGE
$stylesheet='css/authors.css';
require 'header-left-bar.php'; //THIS MUST BE INCLUDED FOR EACH PAGE
?>

<div class="text">
	This is where the author info goes. Or some other main text
</div>
<p>You can use other HTML tags if you want</p>
<img src="images/my-sweet-image.png">You can even go all 1995 on everyone and use img tags!  Make sure to put your image files in the /images directory and reference them there. </img>

<?php require 'right-bar-footer.php'; //THIS MUST BE INCLUDED FOR EACH PAGE ?>

```

# Deploying/Setting up your site
While this could take many different forms and is outside the scope of this document, we will say that we recommend installing [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) locally to test your site out along with [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php).  When deploying to a server, you can simply SSH/SFTP into the server and dump your files there.  Assuming it runs PHP, you should be able to serve the files from there without any additional modifications.

We have provided a simple one page html file in `reference/index.html` that should work on your local machine be opening locally in a browser.  We put that there in order for you to at least see what the main page of the template looks like (sorry - we didn't code out the whole site in static HTML!).


# Power Users
If you are feeling frisky and want to get even more in depth and make some bigger modifcations, the structure is pretty straight forward.  A few things to note to help you navigate a little easier:

### Main CSS Styles
The main css styles can be found condensed into a single file in `css/main-styles.css`.  You will also find the `@media` queries for mobile styling there, too.  We did our best to keep the differences to a minimum, but we get lazy, and/or run out of time to go back and fix something.  

For reference, the media queries are set to break at the standard 600px mark.

We used [basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) for this, and found it to be very nice to work with.  We use flexbox exclusively for the layouts - it makes life easier for responsive sites!  If you add, we strongly recommend you keep using flexbox, else you risk messing up the mobile layout unintentionally.

### CSS CDNs
We used CDNs for a few items that require svgs or icons/fonts.  All the others we made an attempt to internalize.  The CDNs we use are font-awesome for the fonts and Google for Open Sans font.  You can find the link defs at the top of `header-left-bar.php`.

### PHP Requires
You can probably tell if you know anything about PHP, but we tried to keep the includes down to a minimum to simplify the content files for the novice user.  To do it correctly (or more flexibly), you may want to split out the files into sub-files, such as `left-bar.php`, `right-bar.php`, etc.
