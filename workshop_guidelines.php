			CCTA 2017 will offer one-day and half-day workshops addressing current and future topics in control technology and application from experts in academia, national laboratories, and industry. The workshops will take place prior to the conference on Sunday, August 27, 2017. Workshop organizers are invited to submit proposals using the following guidelines.
			<br><br>
Proposals should include the following information: (i) topic, rationale, and format (one-day or half-day); (ii) list of presenters, along with biographical sketches and short abstracts of presentations; (iii) tentative schedule; and (iv) target audience and expected enrollment. Proposals should be submitted through PaperPlaza between December 15, 2016 and April 1, 2017. 

<br><br>
Although the deadline for workshop proposals is April 1, 2017, proposers are encouraged to submit early because space limitations may limit the number of workshops offered and proposals may be accepted before the deadline. Proposers will be notified of acceptance prior to June 1, 2017. Information on cost and process for registration will be available on Paperplaza around June 1, 2017 with all other conference registration information.

<br>  <br>
Potential workshop organizers are encouraged to contact the Workshops Chair, <a href="mailto:rgregg@utdallas.edu" style="color:red">Robert Gregg (rgregg@utdallas.edu)</a>  prior to submitting their proposals.
