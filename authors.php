			<li>	
				Acceptance of articles is made with the understanding that at least one author will attend the conference to deliver a 20-minute presentation; severe disruption to a session is caused if an article is not presented. Therefore, in the event that one of the article's authors cannot attend the conference to make a presentation in the Technical Program, the corresponding author should inform the CCTA 2017 Program Chair as soon as possible and the article will be withdrawn. If the article is not presented at the conference, IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore and the official conference record). 
			</li>
			
			<li>In order to submit the final version of the manuscript and abstract, at least one of the authors of the article must <a href="registration.php" style="color:red">register</a> for the conference to upload the final manuscript. Please note the registration policy with regard to the allowable number of articles that can be uploaded.</li>
			
			<li>All necessary forms needed for submission of the final manuscript will be created by the submission website at the time of final submission. Electronic submission of the final article version through PaperPlaza is due by <strong>July 1, 2017.</strong> </li>

			<li>Final articles must be formatted in the standard 2-column Proceedings format. Please use the standard article templates <a href="http://css.paperplaza.net/conferences/support/support.php" target="_blank" style="color:red">found here.</a></li>

			<li>Please note that the nominal page limit for all articles is six (6) pages; articles exceeding these limits are subject to a page over-length fee. Excess page charges may be paid at the rate of 175 USD per page, where the article length is not to exceed a total of eight (8) pages (PaperPlaza will not permit longer articles to be uploaded).</li>

			<li>PaperPlaza will require that you submit your abstract and make any final changes to the author list and title of the article before uploading the article. After this, no changes can be made.</li>

			<li>Authors making presentations at the conference should plan on bringing their own notebooks/tablets/laptops for their presentations. Although the projectors used in the sessions will have multiple input capabilities (VGA is standard), it is possible that an adaptor may be required. The conference organizers will have a limited number and variety of adapters available on site, but presenters should plan on also bringing their own adapters for their presentation devices.</li>
