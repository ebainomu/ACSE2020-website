	<h2>While at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel</h2>
	<p>
		Please be sure to visit <a style="color:red" href="www.maunalani.com">www.maunalani.com</a> to learn about the rich history and beauty of the surrounding area known as the Mauna Lani Resort. Don't miss out on the guestroom amenities and facilities, as well as the numerous complementary activities as a guest at the hotel included in your resort package. For example, The Mauna Lani Spa and the Sports & Fitness Club are located a short walk or shuttle ride from the hotel. There you will find exercise equipment, a wide array of fitness classes, a lap pool, and tennis (for hotel guests).

		Walking the grounds of the resort is a memorable experience, particularly for exploring nature and the fishponds. Kalahuipua'a Fishponds of Mauna Lani Resort were created by walling off natural access to the ocean, and today span 15 acres in and around the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and the resort. To maintain healthy fish, sluice gates have been incorporated in the pond walls to allow for circulation of sea water. The loko (ponds) feature more than 50 species of I'a (fish), and serve as a reminder of the original inhabitants of the land that is now Mauna Lani. The seven ponds - Kalahuipua'a, Kahinawao, Waipuhi, Waipuhi Iki, Hope'ala, Milokukahi and Manoku - were created by ancient Hawaiians (as far back as 250 B.C.) who used them to raise fish and supplement their diet of fish caught from the ocean.
